# TrivialCompiler

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/TrivialCompiler/TrivialCompiler/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TrivialCompiler/TrivialCompiler)

TrivialCompiler is a compiler written in C++17 that translates SysY (a C-like toy language) into ARM-v7a assembly. It is licensed under [GPLv3](LICENSE).

## Compiling

```bash
mkdir build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # use Release for better performance, Debug for enabling ASan
make -j
./TrivialCompiler -h # show usage
```

## Usage

```
./TrivialCompiler [-l ir_file] [-S] [-p] [-d] [-o output_file] [-O level] input_file
```

Options:

* `-p`: print the names of all passes to run and exit
* `-d`: enable debug mode (WARNING: will produce excessive amount of output)
* `-O`: set optimization level to `level` (no effect on behaviour currently)
* `-l`: dump LLVM IR (text format) to `ir_file` and exit (by running frontend only)
* `-o`: write assembly to `output_file`

You must specify either `-l` or `-o`, or nothing will actually happen.

You could refer to `CMakeLists.txt` on how to converting LLVM IR or assembly to executable file on `ARM-v7a` by using `llc` or `gcc` for assembling and linking.

## Testing

We use `ctest` to automatically test `TrivialCompiler` against several modern compilers. For running tests you need to install the following additional packages and their dependencies:

* `llvm` (to test IR output)
* `g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf`
* `qemu-user` (if not running on ARM-v7a architecture)

Several test cases and corresponding configurable CMake flags are provided:

* `FUNC_TEST` (default `ON`): function test cases provided by the contest committee
* `PERF_TEST` (default `ON`): performance test cases provided by the contest committee
* `CUSTOM_TEST` (default `ON`): test cases written by the authors

And there are more flags to configure whether to use modern compilers to compare with TrivialCompiler

* `GCC` (default `OFF`): use GCC to compile (`-Ofast`) to compare
* `CLANG` (default `OFF`): use Clang (`-Ofast`) to compare, needs `clang` to be installed

After configuring CMake, use `ctest` under your build directory to run all tests.

The results containing stdout and stderr can be located at `build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`. You could use `utils/extract_result.py` to analyze the results and write it into a JSON file.

## Parser Generation

The parser for standard SysY language is located at `srv/conv/parser.{cpp,hpp}`. They are generated by a parser generator [lalr1](https://github.com/MashPlant/lalr1) developed by [@MashPlant](https://github.com/MashPlant/) from `parser.toml`.

If you want to generate from a modified version of `parser.toml`, first intall `parser_gen` (requires nightly Rust toolchain):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MashPlant/lalr1 --features="clap toml"
```

Then invoke `utils/gen_parser.py` to generate and split the output. This script will also slightly modify the generated code, so that it will meet our usage better.

Please note that there is a minor problem with the generated lexer: the output tables may be different through each run (the lexer will behave consistently in spite of this, of course). So if you want to contribute to the project, and have regenerated `srv/conv/parser.{cpp,hpp}` without actually modifying the lexer, it would be helpful if you change the lexer tables back before committing, so that the commit log will be more clear.
